Program scrapes real time data, clean the data (can handle billions of data points), backtest through chosen alogrithm, and graph results. Everything is automated, user only have to choose stock ticker and deep learning parameters. 

"AlphaVantage" is a module that scrapes live data, process it, and feed to the main directory. "backteting_analysis_graphing_software.py" allows the user to select any stock in the US market and backtest. A graphical analysis and summary will automatically be generated. All code were written by me.
